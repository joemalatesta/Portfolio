  Hello! I'm Joe Malatesta, a highly motivated and dedicated Instructional Associate with 2 years of experience at General Assembly. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in classroom support, technical troubleshooting, student engagement, and curriculum development. My passion lies in enhancing the learning experience and contributing to student success.
  At General Assembly, I have been actively collaborating with instructors to create engaging classroom environments that foster better learning outcomes. I take pride in my ability to assist with technical setups and troubleshooting to ensure seamless class delivery. Additionally, I provide valuable feedback on student assignments and projects, helping them grow and improve.
  My commitment to student success extends to managing administrative tasks, such as attendance tracking and student records. I strongly believe in creating an inclusive and positive learning environment, where every student feels supported and encouraged.
  One of the highlights of my experience at General Assembly is my contribution to curriculum development. I've been part of the team that has crafted and refined courses to meet the ever-evolving needs of the software engineering field. Analyzing solutions and coding fixes for software problems is a challenge I embrace, and I've also actively developed web applications using a variety of engineering languages.
  Before my career in education, I gained valuable experience as a Heavy Equipment Mechanic at LevelGreen Landscaping, where I diagnosed and repaired mechanical equipment, conducted DOT inspections on fleet vehicles, and maintained water transfer equipment. I also managed parts inventory and warehouse while training employees on equipment usage and maintenance.
  During my tenure as a SHOP MANAGER at Community Bridge Inc, I further honed my mechanical expertise, managing parts inventory and warehouse, and training employees on equipment repairs and best practices.
  Earlier in my career, I worked as a SMALL ENGINE MECHANIC at Penhall Construction, diagnosing and repairing hydraulic, diesel, and electric concrete cutting equipment, and conducting troubleshooting and repairs both in-shop and in the field.
  In addition to my professional experience, I hold a Certificate of Completion in full-time Software Engineering from General Assembly, where I refined my skills in JavaScript, React, Python, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML/CSS, Express, MySQL, and various web technologies.
  My journey of education and skill development started with general studies courses at Baltimore International College and Anne Arundel Community College.
  I am a problem solver by nature, and I enjoy tackling complex challenges head-on. I adhere to best practices and standards in code development, testing, and troubleshooting, ensuring high-quality outcomes in all my projects.
